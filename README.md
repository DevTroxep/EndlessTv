# Project Introduction

EndlessTV is my ReactJS front-end course defense project at [SoftUni](https://softuni.bg/). The website is a 
Single Page Application (SPA) where you can watch movies free of charge.

# ‚úèÔ∏è Overview

EndlessTV is a free platform where you can watch your favorite movies with just a click of button. All you need is a quick registration and you'll have access to various movie genres, top rated movies or even the latest hits. Once you've picked your movies, EndlessTV provides an option to put them in a neat Favorites list. There is also a comment section in each movie, so you can share your movie experience with others.
